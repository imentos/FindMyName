### 5️⃣ Engagement Strategy

- Track **saves, shares, YES comments** as validation metrics
- Ignore likes; they don’t reflect true demand

- Target audience: parents, swim meet attendees, kids’ activities
- Budget: start $5–10/day for 3–5 days
- Objective: Engagement / Video Views
- Optional: boost via Meta Business Suite for more targeting options

### 7️⃣ Cross-Platform Strategy
- Share hooks to **Facebook Reels, YouTube Shorts, and Stories**
- Tag local pools / swim clubs
- Use branded hashtag #FindMyName consistently

### 8️⃣ Branding Consistency
- Colors & fonts: match app UI
- Tone: friendly, light humor, parent-oriented
- Overlay style: consistent across all hooks

### 9️⃣ Phase 2 (App Reveal)
- After validation, create new reels showing **app solving the problem**
- Use same hooks but transition: frustration → instant solution
- Add download CTA and App Store / Play Store links
